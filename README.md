## **Requirements**

### **software**

>(possible supported version/developing environment):

- gfortran (4.7/4.8)

- GNU make (/3.82)


## **Installation**

### clone

```shell
git clone xxx
```

### Setup

#### GNU solftwares

- Generally, gnu `make` and `gfortran` are pre-installed on linux machines. Try `make --version` and `gfortran --version` to check if they exist. If not, use package manager to install them.    


#### Makefile

### Install

```shell

## Run a Simulation

- The input file of COMCOT is called `comcot.ctl`. Modify the file to specify a simulation time, time step, fault parameters, and grid settings. Additionally, a corresponding topographic file (available at [etopo](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/)) is required for grid construction, and the path to the file should be provided in `comcot.ctl`. For example, the fresh downloaded `comcot.ctl` takes `../etopo_halk2.xyz` as the topographic file and simulate the 2011 T≈çhoku tsunami.

- To run the simulation, simply execute the program `comcot`

 ```shell
 ./comcot
 ```

## Features


## **Acknowledgements**

gfortran compatible version of COMCOT was developed by Tao, Chiu at Tsunami reseach group, IHOS, NCU. The goal of this work is to librate, coporate ideas with the community and accelerate the development of a high-throughput tsunami warning system at a relatively low cost. Original COMCOT version can be found at [here](http://223.4.213.26/archive/tsunami/cornell/comcot_down.htm).
